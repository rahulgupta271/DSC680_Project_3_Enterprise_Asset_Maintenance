# Project Name: Enterprise Asset Maintenance


## Project Description: 

For this Project, I am applying a predictive maintenance model, using an example case where the aim is to anticipate faults due to some system components. The analysis includes feature engineering, feature selection, labeling, training and evaluation of this predictive model. Predictive models are built with Python packages.

## Getting Started

These directions will give you a copy of the project that will be running on your local computer for production and testing purposes. See Implementation for notes on how to deploy the project to a live device.These directions will give you a copy of the project that will be running on your local computer for production and testing purposes.
